# Prerequisites

Before starting to code, please make sure you have [erdpy](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-sdk) installed.

Check out the [erdpy documentation](https://docs.elrond.com/tools/erdpy) on details on how to install and how it works.

Erdpy will install take care of all the dependencies needed for building smart contracts!

Feel free any IDE that you like. This tutorial focuses on CLI interaction.
Note, however, that we also have a VSCode extension in the works, which will expose the same functionality directly in the IDE.
