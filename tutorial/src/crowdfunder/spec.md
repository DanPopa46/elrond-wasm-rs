# Specifications

A blockchain user wants to gather some funds for a cool project. The most transparent way to do so is via a smart contract.

In its simplest form, anyone enthusiatic with the project can donate a sum of ERD. The project, however, has a minimum amount that it needs in order to start. If that threshold is reached, the owner of the contract gets the money, otherwise everyone else gets their investment back.

The contract needs to have this threshold specified from the very beginning. This threshold needs to be and immutable. It also needs to specify a deadline for gathering the funds.
